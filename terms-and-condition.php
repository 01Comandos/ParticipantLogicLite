								<h3>A. General Terms and Conditions for using the SHOCKLOGIC service</h3>
								<p>The SHOCKLOGIC service is rendered via websites (e.g. Shocklogic.com, Shoc, Shocklogic.com), a number of different sub-domains and domain aliases, and via mobile applications (“apps”), background applications, web services and third-party-site integrations (e.g. iFrame). All websites, sub-domains, aliases, mobile applications, background applications, web services and third-party-site integrations provided by SHOCKLOGIC and where SHOCKLOGIC is available are hereinafter referred to as <strong>“SHOCKLOGIC Websites”</strong>. <br> <br>The SHOCKLOGIC service applications include, in particular, contact and communication forums (hereinafter referred to as <strong>“social network”</strong>) for which the user can obtain membership, an <strong>“events platform”</strong> and an <strong>“employer review platform”</strong>. Some of the SHOCKLOGIC applications October appear under other brand names or by using other SHOCKLOGIC Websites. <br> <br>These General Terms and Conditions for using the SHOCKLOGIC service govern the contractual relationship between the user and SHOCKLOGIC, irrespective of which SHOCKLOGIC Websites the User visits to take use SHOCKLOGIC services. <br><br>Additional terms October also apply to the use of individual applications in addition to these General Terms and Conditions for using the SHOCKLOGIC service. In the event of an objection, the additional terms and conditions for the use of the respective application shall take precedence over these General Terms and Conditions for using the SHOCKLOGIC service, provided such precedence is not excluded in the additional terms for the use of the respective application. <br><br>The General Terms and Conditions for using the SHOCKLOGIC service and any additional terms for the use of individual applications are hereinafter referred to as <strong>“GTC”</strong>. <br><br>The contract is concluded with Appxcell Limited, 49 Effra Rd., Eurolink, Unit 46, London SW21BZ, UK. </p>

								<h3>1. Subject and basis for using SHOCKLOGIC</h3>
								<p> <strong>General</strong> <br>1.1 SHOCKLOGIC is a service that pursues the aim of improving and simplifying the user’s working life by providing a variety of different applications. <br>1.2 Working and private lives are converging all the time. In light of this, SHOCKLOGIC focuses both on professional and private domains. <br>1.3 SHOCKLOGIC would particularly like to provide the user with new opportunities (mainly within a professional context, but also within a private context), make it easier for the user to form horizontal networks, democratise information, foster the exchange of information, and promote lifelong learning. In order to meet these aims, SHOCKLOGIC collects information in order to provide the user with certain information, offers, recommendations and services, and to promote interaction within the user’s network. This takes place in line with the user’s privacy settings and declarations of consent. <br>1.4 The social network is the core application of the SHOCKLOGIC service. The profile page created by the user on the social network (hereinafter referred to as <strong>"user profile"</strong>) represents the identity of the user within the SHOCKLOGIC service, on SHOCKLOGIC Websites, and in the service’s applications. In order to use SHOCKLOGIC, the user requires a user profile that is visible on the social network. Only individual applications of the SHOCKLOGIC service can be used where the user profile is not visible on the social network. Also, there are individual applications of the SHOCKLOShocklogicGIC service where the user does not appear and is not displayed with their user profile. Registration with the SHOCKLOGIC service is, however, always required. <br><br><strong>Social network</strong> <br>1.5 The social network provides the user with various options to present themselves with a personal user profile and to present their activities on SHOCKLOGIC Websites and, where applicable, outside of the SHOCKLOGIC Websites, and to interact with other users and, where applicable, with third parties in real time. <br>1.6 A user who registers with the social network initially becomes a free member of the social network (hereinafter referred to as <strong>“free membership”</strong>). <br>1.7 The user has the option of switching their free membership to a paid membership on the social network (paid membership on the social network is hereinafter referred to as <strong>“Premium membership”</strong>). In contrast to free membership, Premium membership provides a number of additional and advanced features. Special paid memberships for specific target groups, e.g. recruiters, are also covered by the term “Premium membership”. Depending on the user’s choice of payment method for the Premium membership as offered by SHOCKLOGIC, the specific provisions as laid out in Section 6.6 (“Special provisions regarding the payment methods offered by SHOCKLOGIC”) shall apply as of 1 October 2014. Free membership and Premium membership will hereinafter be collectively referred to as <strong>“SHOCKLOGIC membership”</strong>. <br>1.8 If SHOCKLOGIC offers the user the option to book one or more free or paid third-party supplementary services, the user shall enter into separate agreements with the respective third party that have no legal connection to the user's SHOCKLOGIC membership. The amendment, discontinuation, other termination or exchange of such third-party services or any default of performance thereof in relations between the user and third party does not have any impact on the contractual relationship between SHOCKLOGIC and the user in terms of the user's SHOCKLOGIC membership. The terms and conditions and privacy policies of the respective third parties, who are also the contractual and contact partners of the user, apply to all third-party supplementary services. </p>

								<h3>2. Conditions of use, conclusion of contract and warranties upon conclusion of contract</h3>
								<p><strong>General</strong> <br>2.1 If the user uses a SHOCKLOGIC service application which can also be used by users without a user profile that is visible on the social network, a user account will be created for said user if they do not already have one. Thereby, the agreement to use SHOCKLOGIC is entered into by the user and SHOCKLOGIC. A user account is a user profile that is not initially visible on the social network. To start with, the user can only use their user account with SHOCKLOGIC service applications that can also be used without a user profile that is visible on the social network. If the user would like to use SHOCKLOGIC service applications that require a user profile that is visible on the social network, the user must first allow their user profile to be visible on the social network. <br>2.2 The option to use applications offered on the SHOCKLOGIC Websites does not constitute an offer, but merely an invitation to issue an offer. By completing the booking process, the user consents to enter into the agreement to use the corresponding SHOCKLOGIC application. SHOCKLOGIC in turn accepts the user’s consent by rendering the corresponding services. The agreement takes effect upon the aforementioned acceptance by SHOCKLOGIC. SHOCKLOGIC is not obliged to enter into the agreement. By using paid services, the user accepts the related payment obligation and, depending on the choice of payment method and as of 1 October 2014, the special provisions as laid out in Section 6.6 (“Special provisions regarding the payment methods offered by SHOCKLOGIC”) by clicking on the confirmation button which is displayed in such cases. <br>2.3 The user warrants and represents that all of the data they provide is accurate and complete. The user is obliged to ensure that the data for all of the applications they use is accurate and complete for the entire duration of the agreement. In the event that the SHOCKLOGIC customer service team makes any manual changes to the user’s data on the user’s behalf, SHOCKLOGIC reserves the right to bill the user for any costs it incurs in connection with said changes, insofar as the user is responsible for the event that triggers these costs. <br>2.4 The user warrants that they are of legal age. In the event that the user acts on behalf of a legal person for certain applications, the user warrants that they are authorised to act in the name of the legal person. Upon request, the user shall submit proof thereof. <br>2.5 It is technically impossible for SHOCKLOGIC to determine with certainty whether any user registered on the SHOCKLOGIC Websites is in fact the person he or she claims to be. Therefore, SHOCKLOGIC assumes no liability for the actual identity of a user. <br><br><strong>Social network</strong> <br>2.6 In order to acquire SHOCKLOGIC membership, the user must register on the platform and select a password. <br>2.7 The user is obliged to keep this password secret. SHOCKLOGIC shall not disclose the password to any third party, shall only use it during the login process, and shall not ask for the user's password at any time other than during the login process. For security reasons and to prevent misuse, the user is recommended to change their password at regular intervals. The user is solely responsible for safeguarding and storing their SHOCKLOGIC member account login details (username and password). <br>2.8 Each user October only create one user profile. The user is not permitted to allow third parties to use their user profile. </p>

								<h3>5. Changes to services and GTC</h3>
								<p><strong>Changes to services</strong> <br>5.1 SHOCKLOGIC reserves the right to modify the services offered on the SHOCKLOGIC Websites or to offer services different from those offered at the time of the user’s registration at any time unless this is unreasonable for the user. <br>5.2 SHOCKLOGIC furthermore reserves the right to modify the services offered on the SHOCKLOGIC Websites or to offer services different from those offered at the time of the user’s registration at any time <br>(a) to the extent SHOCKLOGIC is obliged to ensure the services that it offers are in compliance with legislation incumbent upon the services, particularly in the event of a change to said legislation, <br>(b) to the extent SHOCKLOGIC is therefore deemed to have complied with a legal judgement or decision by the authorities, <br>(c) to the extent the respective modification is required to eliminate any existing security gaps, <br>(d) if the modification is only beneficial to the user, or <br>(e) if the modification is of a purely technical or process-related nature without any material impact on the user. <br>5.3 Modifications that only have a minor impact on SHOCKLOGIC’s functionality do not represent changes to the services described in this section. This shall apply in particular to changes of a purely graphical nature and to a change of layout and/or placement of features. <br><br><strong>Changes to GTC</strong> <br>5.4 SHOCKLOGIC reserves the right to amend these GTC at any time, without giving reasons, unless an amendment is unreasonable to the user. SHOCKLOGIC shall give due notice to the user regarding amendments to these GTC. If the user does not object to the validity of the revised GTC within six (6) weeks of receipt of said notice, the amended GTC shall be deemed accepted by the user. In its notice, SHOCKLOGIC shall inform the user about the user’s right to object and the importance of the objection deadline. <br>5.5 SHOCKLOGIC also reserves the right to modify the GTC <br>(a) if the modification is only beneficial to the user, <br>(b) if the modification is of a purely technical or process-related nature without any material impact for the user, <br>(c) to the extent SHOCKLOGIC is obliged to ensure the GTC comply with legislation incumbent thereon, particularly in the event of a change to said legislation, <br>(d) to the extent SHOCKLOGIC is therefore deemed to have complied with a legal judgement or decision by the authorities, or <br>(e) to the extent SHOCKLOGIC introduces supplementary, completely new services or service components requiring a service description in the GTC, unless this has a detrimental impact on the use relationship to date.SHOCKLOGIC shall notify users of such changes to its GTC, e.g. via the SHOCKLOGIC Websites. <br>5.6 Products that are booked separately and not offered within the scope of a continuing obligation (e.g. booking ads or posting events) are subject to a separate agreement for which additional terms and conditions will be explicitly displayed prior to booking.

								<h3>6. Fees, billing, invoicing, payment terms</h3>
								<p><strong>General</strong> <br>6.1 The user can settle invoices using the payment methods offered by SHOCKLOGIC. If SHOCKLOGIC is unable to collect any fees from an account designated by the user due to lack of funds, the user shall bear all costs SHOCKLOGIC incurs as a result thereof, including bank charges related to any debit entries or similar charges, insofar as the user is responsible for the event that triggers these costs. <br>6.2 SHOCKLOGIC is permitted to only send invoices and payment reminders electronically. <br>6.3 Provided the user does not object, SHOCKLOGIC reserves the right to switch invoices from euros to the user’s respective local currency at any time. <br><br><strong>Premium membership</strong> <br>6.4 Premium membership fees are due immediately for the full term. <br>6.5 SHOCKLOGIC reserves the right to reasonably increase the fees charged for Premium membership with effect from the start of a new renewal period, either after the initial term or the respective current renewal period. Prices October only be increased once per calendar year. In such cases, SHOCKLOGIC shall inform the user at least six (6) weeks prior to expiry of the initial term or respective current renewal period. Should the user not agree to this increase, they October object to the validity of the increase within three (3) weeks of notification via the contact form, letter, fax or e-mail. The user’s submission of an objection is tantamount to cancelling their Premium membership, meaning that said membership will expire at the end of the initial term or respective current renewal period. <br><em>Please note: Section 6.5 does not apply to existing customers who registered with SHOCKLOGIC before 17 October 2014, except in the following cases: <br>•         An older version of the GTC containing a corresponding price modification provision (in Section 12.2) in effect at the time of registration was already explicitly agreed to <br>•         A price modification provision was already explicitly agreed to before 17 October 2014, e.g. when switching from the old Premium to the New Premium version <br>•         A price modification provision was explicitly agreed to after 17 October 2014 <br>•         These GTC including the price modification provision (Section 6.5) are explicitly agreed to from 17 October 2014 (e.g. when taking out Premium membership). <br>This price modification provision (Section 6.5) shall apply without limitation to new customers.</em> <br><br><strong>6.6 Special provisions regarding the payment methods offered by SHOCKLOGIC <em>Please note: This Section 6.6 will become effective as of 1 October 2014.</em></strong> <br>If case the user opts for a Premium membership as of 1 October 2014, chooses credit card as the applicable payment method, and pays with his MasterCard or Visa Card (not American Express), the following special provisions shall apply: <br>•         Party to the contract are both Appxcell Limited . who is severally liable towards the user. This means, inter alia, that the provision of a service by one party fulfils the contractual obligation of the other. Events such as contestation, termination or withdrawal of the contract by the user, default or impossibility of performance or any other event listed in Section 425 (2) of the German Civil Code (BGB) will take effect for and against both parties. <br>•         Appxcell Limited . do not form one company but act for themselves respectively. Appxcell Limited . exclusively act in their own name vis-à-vis the user unless expressly stated otherwise. <br>•         Even though Appxcell Limited . is entitled to claim payment in the full amount from the user, the user is of course only obliged to make such payment once. The user must, however, bear in mind that they are not entitled (notwithstanding Section 428 sentence 1 of the German Civil Code) to make payment at their discretion to either APPXCELL LIMITED or SHOCKLOGIC ., but that they are required to exclusively make payment to the party demanding payment from them (unreal joint creditors, Section 428 sentence 1 of the German Civil Code). To this end, the user only needs to follow the instructions on the SHOCKLOGIC Websites. <br>•         The user’s contact person for all questions regarding their membership or the SHOCKLOGIC Websites is exclusively APPXCELL LIMITED. The contact details can be found on the SHOCKLOGIC Websites. <br>When a user opts for a non-paid membership or chooses to pay for their Premium membership with a payment method other than MasterCard or Visa Card, only APPXCELL LIMITED becomes a party to the contract (in this case the name “SHOCKLOGIC” in these GTC refers exclusively to APPXCELL LIMITED). The special provisions regarding the joint and several liability and joint creditors in case of payment by MasterCard or Visa Card do not apply. As soon as the user has chosen a payment method for their Premium membership, they will receive information stating the parties to the contract as well as details as to which party will provide the contractual service.</p>

								<h3>7. Term, termination of contract, sanctions, reimbursement of advance payments</h3>
								<p><strong>General</strong> <br>7.1 Unless specifically precluded by separate terms and conditions regarding the term and termination of individual applications or SHOCKLOGIC memberships, the contractual relationship October be terminated by either party at any time. <br><br><strong>Unpaid membership</strong> <br>7.2 SHOCKLOGIC and the user may terminate free membership at any time without cause. In order to protect the user from unauthorised deletion of their user profile by third parties, SHOCKLOGIC October perform an identity check upon termination, e.g. by requesting the username and an e-mail address registered on the SHOCKLOGIC Websites. <br><br><strong>Premium membership</strong> <br>7.3 Premium membership shall run for the initial term selected by the user during the upgrade process. After this term, the Premium membership will be renewed by a term of the same length as the initial term, unless terminated in due time by the user or SHOCKLOGIC. The user and SHOCKLOGIC may each terminate Premium membership without cause to the end of the initial term selected by the user during registration process, or to the end of any renewal period after said minimum term expires, by serving notice of three (3) weeks via the contact form, letter, fax or e-mail. If Premium membership has been terminated, the user is entitled to retain free membership until this membership is terminated, meaning that the additional and advanced Premium membership features will no longer be available. <br><br><strong>Cancellation and suspension for good cause</strong> <br>7.4 Even if separate terms and conditions regarding term and cancellation are in place, both parties are entitled to immediate extraordinary termination for good cause at any time. Extraordinary termination for good cause is defined as an event which makes it unacceptable for the terminating party to continue the agreement until the end of the termination period, taking into account all circumstances of the individual case and weighing up the interests of both parties. A good cause for SHOCKLOGIC includes any of the following events: <br>•         If the user fails to comply with any applicable legal provisions <br>•         If the user breaches a contractual obligation <br>•         If the reputation of the services offered on the SHOCKLOGIC Websites is substantially impaired by the online presence of the user (if, for example, it is discovered after registration that the user has been convicted of a criminal offence, and if said conviction is known to other users) <br>•         If the user promotes any communities or associations, or any of their methods or activities, which are under surveillance by authorities responsible for public safety or the protection of minors <br>•         If the user causes harm to any other user(s) or <br>•         If the user is a member of a religious sect or a denomination that is controversial in Germany. <br>7.5 In the event of a good cause in accordance with Section 7.4 and notwithstanding SHOCKLOGIC’s right to terminate the contract in accordance with Section 7.4, SHOCKLOGIC is entitled to <br>•         delete contents posted by the user <br>•         block the user’s access to the services on the SHOCKLOGIC Websites or to individual applications, or to <br>•         issue a warning. <br>7.6 The user's right to claim reimbursement of any advance payments upon termination shall be excluded unless the user has terminated the agreement for good cause attributable to SHOCKLOGIC. In the following cases, the user shall not be entitled to claim reimbursement of any advance payments: <br>•         If SHOCKLOGIC has terminated the contract for good cause <br>•         If SHOCKLOGIC has blocked the user’s access in accordance with Section 7.5</p>

								<h3>8. Responsibility for the user’s content, data and/or other information, availability</h3>
								<p>8.1 SHOCKLOGIC does not accept any responsibility for any content, data and/or information provided or made available by users of the SHOCKLOGIC Websites on any external websites linked to them. In particular, SHOCKLOGIC does not warrant that said data and/or information is true or accurate, nor that it fulfils or serves any particular purpose. <br>8.2 The user October report any activities of any other user which violate applicable laws and/or any of these contractual terms (including the use of pseudonyms or false identities). <br>8.3 SHOCKLOGIC is not obliged to prohibit third parties from saving data or content that is or was publicly available pursuant to the GTC, SHOCKLOGIC Privacy Policy or user settings. <br>8.4 SHOCKLOGIC merely provides the user with a platform and is not involved in the content of communication between users. This does not apply if SHOCKLOGIC moderates a group. If users enter into agreements with one another via SHOCKLOGIC Websites, SHOCKLOGIC shall not be a contracting party to said agreements. Users are solely responsible for the execution and/or fulfilment of agreements they enter into with one another. SHOCKLOGIC shall not be liable for breaches of duty in relation to agreements entered into between users. <br>8.5 The user acknowledges and agrees that it is technically impossible to achieve 100% availability of the SHOCKLOGIC Websites. SHOCKLOGIC shall nonetheless endeavour to keep SHOCKLOGIC Websites available without interruption. Events related to maintenance, security or capacity requirements, and/or events beyond SHOCKLOGIC’s control (e.g. disruptions to public communications networks, power failures, etc.), October result in malfunctions of or temporary interruptions to the service provided on SHOCKLOGIC Websites. </p>

								<h3>9. Liability of SHOCKLOGIC</h3>
								<p>9.1 SHOCKLOGIC shall be liable without limitation for damages resulting from injury to life, limb or health which occur due to a breach of duty by SHOCKLOGIC or one of its legal representatives or vicarious agents. SHOCKLOGIC shall also be liable without limitation for damages owing to a lack of a characteristic warranted by SHOCKLOGIC or due to malicious conduct by SHOCKLOGIC. In addition, SHOCKLOGIC shall be liable without limitation for damages due to intent or gross negligence by SHOCKLOGIC or one of its legal representatives or vicarious agents. <br>9.2 Apart from the cases set out in sections 9.1 and 9.3, SHOCKLOGIC’s liability shall be limited to typical foreseeable contractual damages in the event of a breach of any of its cardinal contractual duties due to slight negligence. Cardinal contractual duties are an abstract description of those obligations whose fulfilment is indispensable for the proper implementation of an agreement and on whose fulfilment the contracting parties can usually rely. Any other liability on the part of SHOCKLOGIC is excluded. <br>9.3 Liability pursuant to the German Product Liability Act shall remain unaffected.</p>

								<h3>10. Data protection</h3>
								<p>10.1 Personal data is only collected, processed and/or used if the user grants consent to do so or if permitted by law. SHOCKLOGIC uses personal data to the extent permitted by law, in particular to fulfil its contractual obligations vis-à-vis users. SHOCKLOGIC provides the user with a range of customised features, i.e. SHOCKLOGIC serves the user certain information, offers, recommendations and services, and promotes interaction within the user’s network based on collected data. In order to render these services, SHOCKLOGIC needs to process and use the user’s personal data. <br>10.2 SHOCKLOGIC provides users with the option of sending their personal data, in whole or in part, to other users, or to prevent other users from viewing their data. Such data is sent at the user’s own risk. </p>
